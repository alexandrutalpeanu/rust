PdMasterKee is a new project. It's, like the name suggests, a Password Database for sites and local desktop applications. 

It is made by me and helped by CristianGalusca to be used with my new 
YubiKey Fido Edition from Yubico.

It is intended to be made with Rust standards, like web assembly
and run separately like "WhatsApp Web" with sudo to apply the security provided by
the operating system with the help of YubiKey.

Simple observation: it does not require any YubiKey.
